# Stock Analysis VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a macro that would calculate the total daily volume and percent return for each stock ticker. We can run the analysis for either 2017 or 2018. Any tickers with a negative return are indicated with red cells, while tickers with positive returns are indicated in green.

## Results

### Stock Performance

Generally speaking, our analysis showed that 2017 was a better year for stock performance than 2018. In 2017, only one stock had a negative return: TERP. On the other hand, in 2018 all of the stocks had negative returns, with the exception of ENPH and RUN.
Additionally, in 2017, four stocks (DQ, SEDG, ENPH, and FSLR) had returns greater than 100% and were performing very highly, but in 2018 these returns decreased. DQ, SEDG, and FSLR show negative returns in 2018, while returns for ENPH decreased from 129.5% to 81.9%.

## Summary
One advantage of refactoring code is that it can make the code more efficient so that it runs more quickly and doesn't require as much memory.
However, refactoring code takes time that may not end up being worthwhile. For example, since the VBA script is not analyzing a huge amount of data and won't be used on a regular basis, the additional time that it took to refactor the code may not have made a meaningful difference in the grand scheme of things. That time could have been spent writing scripts for additional analyses or refactoring scripts that have more room for improvement.
